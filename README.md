## **2. Your First Overlay: Essential Steps**

Follow these steps to place your design on the canvas with the best possible color quality.

**Step 1: Create and Configure**
1. Open the VoX panel in Wplace.
2. Go to the **Overlays** tab and click **+ Add**.
3. Go to the **Editor** tab.

**Step 2: Choose Color Mode (NEW!)**
Before uploading your image, select the **Mode** that best suits your design from the drop-down menu:
* **🌿 Natural:** (Default) Ideal for photographs, memes and soft gradients.
* **⚡ Vibrant:** Perfect for logos, text and bright neon colors.
* **💀 Heavy (Anime):** A heavy math mode that prioritizes exact pitch (HSV). Use it for complex Pixel Art or Anime. (🚨Caution: This rendering mode is VERY HEAVY and could ruin your progress!)

**Step 3: Upload the Image**
* **From URL:** Paste the direct link and click **Upload**.
* **Local File:** Click on the dotted box to upload it from your device.
    *(The script will process the colors automatically to eliminate errors.)*

**Step 4: Pin to Canvas**
1. Click the **Set Position: OFF** button (it will change to **ON**).
2. Click on the game canvas, exactly on the pixel where you want the top left corner (0,0) of your image to start.
3. Ready! The image will be fixed.

## **3. Main Panel and Display Modes**

- **Overlay: ON/OFF** → Show or hide all your designs.
- **Mode: Minify** → Change the Overlay display:
  - *Minify (Recommended):* Displays small dots on the canvas (pattern) to see below.
  - *Behind/Above:* Displays the entire image behind or in front of the canvas.
  - *Original:* Hide the overlay to see the real map.
- **Show Errors: ON/OFF** → Mark pixels that do not match your design in bright red.

> **💡 Performance Tip:** There is no longer a "Reload" button. If you change the opacity, position or filters, the script will warn you. You just have to **move the map a little** or paint a pixel to see the changes.

## **4. Advanced Features per Tab**

### **Overlays Tab**
* **Individual Management:** Now, each Overlay saves its own color filter settings. You can have multiple assets with different configurations.

### **Editor Tab**
* **Opacity:** Controls the transparency of the Overlay.
* **Nudge:** Use the arrows to move the image pixel by pixel if the initial position was not precise.
* **Capacity:** Support for images up to **3000x3000px**!

### **Tools Tab**
* **Copy Canvas:** 
    1. Set **Point A**.
    2. Set **Point B**.
    3. Click **Detect and Download** to get an exact copy of that area of ​​the canvas.

* **Show Overlay Progress:** Opens a floating panel for real-time tracking.
    * **Color List:** Shows how many pixels are missing of each color.

Enjoy creating on **wplace.live** with VoX Overlay Pro! 🚀
I honestly had no intention of finishing it, but I had a burst of creativity and here you go. (I don't think I will publish more updates) unless they are to update compatibility.
