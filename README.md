## 3. Main Panel and Display Modes

- **Overlay: ON/OFF** → Show or hide all designs.
- **Mode: Minify** → Change overlay display:
  - *Minify (Recommended)*: Small dots for seeing below the overlay.
  - *Behind/Above*: Displays the image behind or in front of the canvas.
  - *Original*: Hides the overlay to see the real map.
- **Show Errors: ON/OFF** → Highlights pixels that do not match your design in red.
- **Player Stats (Username / Level / Droplets / Next Level)** → Automatically reads your account data from Wplace and shows:
  - **Droplets** with dynamic color based on amount:
    - 0–499: default text color
    - 500–1999: yellow (able to increase max by 5 paint or buy 30 paint)
    - 2000–19,999: green (buy a color)
    - 20,000+: red (buy flag or change icon)

💡 **Tip:** Adjust opacity, position, or filters, then move the map slightly or paint a pixel to see changes. No reload required.
